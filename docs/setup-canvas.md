## Configuring GitHub Classroom in Canvas

These steps will walk you through the process of configuring GitHub Classroom as an external tool within Canvas.

### Prerequisites

1. An up-to-date version of Canvas
1. [Credentials generated by GitHub Classroom](/help/generate-lms-credentials) (keep this page easily accessible during
the configuration process)

### Step by step installation guide

1. Log into Canvas.
1. Select the Canvas course to integrate with GitHub Classroom.
1. In the course sidebar, navigate to _Settings_, then _Apps_.

   </div>

1. Click **+ App** in the top right. A popup appears.
1. In _Configuration Type_ dropdown, select **By URL**.

   <div class="text-center">
     <img src="/images/help/lms/canvas/step-6.png" class="border" style="width: 75%;">
   </div>

1. Fill in the following options:

    | Option | Set to |
    |-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Consumer Key | The _Consumer key_ generated by GitHub Classroom |
    | Shared Secret | The _Shared secret_ generated by GitHub Classroom |
    | Allow this tool to access the IMS  Names and Role Provisioning Service  <br/><br/> _Note: if you do not see this option, please see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)_ | Checked |
    | Configuration URL | The _Launch URL_  generated by GitHub Classroom |

    After entering that information, the form should look like:

    <div class="text-center">
      <img src="/images/help/lms/canvas/step-7.png" class="border" style="width: 75%;">
    </div>

1. Click _Submit_ and navigate out of settings.

   <div class="text-center">
     <img src="/images/help/lms/canvas/step-9.png" class="border" style="width: 30%;">
   </div>

1. Click _GitHub Classroom_ to finish linking GitHub Classroom. You should see following screen:

    <div class="text-center">
      <img src="/images/help/lms/canvas/success.png" class="border" style="width: 75%;">
    </div>

### Troubleshooting: _Enable Membership Service_ checkbox is not visible

If you don’t see a checkbox in Canvas labeled _Allow this tool to access the IMS Names and Role Provisioning Service_, then you may have to ask your institution’s Canvas administrator to enable _Membership Service Configuration_ for your account.

</div>

You may continue linking GitHub Classroom to Canvas without this capability, but you will be unable to sync your roster from Canvas to GitHub Classroom.

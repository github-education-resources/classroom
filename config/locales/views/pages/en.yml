          Developers rarely work all by themselves, on a deadline, or ship something they’ll only use once (with no idea whether it actually works). Wouldn’t students be better served by showing versions of their work, iterating, checking in on milestones, and showing off the final product? <br><br>
          With GitHub Classroom you can set up the industry-standard workflow and free up your time to focus on teaching. Classroom will automatically create student repositories, track assignments in your dashboard and integrate with third-party tools like automated testing. <br><br>
          With Classroom, you can spin up your course on GitHub and move on to the good stuff.
